# Chat App In Java

This is a basic chat app in Java. I'm planning to continue enhancements, as well as to create a similar app in Kotlin. 

In order to test this out, you can clone the repository. Once you've got the project on you're local machine make sure to 
+ Run the server first
+ Then run the ChatClientUI.java file.
+ Run multiple instances by creating several instances of the ChatClientUI and running all of them at the same time
+ I'm using Intellij, and was able to create new instances by clicking the dropdown next to the name of the 'current file' on the upper right hand side of the screen. 
+ Once in the configurations window, select the '+' button, then choose 'Application'. You can then name it whatever you choose
+ Don't forget to specify the ChatClientUI class where it says 'Main Class'
+ Click apply
+ Create as many of these instances as you want and then run them to test out the program on your local machine.
